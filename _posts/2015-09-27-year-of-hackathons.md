For many years now, I've had side projects and technologies that live on the perpetual to-do list. To make a dent in this list, I'm going to do what every self-help book has prescribed: add some structure, write down some goals, and make small incremental progress.

I find that I learn best when creating a project, rather than following the many tutorials and docs online. And I also find it best to learn (at least initially) when working in a large burst, rather than small bits of time. I liken it to reading a book; it's much easier to get into a good read when you can devote two hours to it rather than 10 minutes here and there.

### The project

12 side projects in 12 months. One weekend per month, I will pick a side project to build and a complementary technology to learn. I will devote that weekend to bringing that project to life.

Here are the ground rules:

* The project must have serve at least one complete atomic function. 
* The project must use the chosen technology in a non-trivial way.
* The project must have a write-up on this blog.
* The source code must be posted publicly online on my Github repository.
