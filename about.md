### Zack Hall

I'm a designer and developer. I'm 1/2 of the [Burpee Over Bar](http://burpeeoverbar.com) team building beautiful web and mobile experiences for CrossFit. I'm an Amazon engineer where I'm working the Alexa team. Formerly, I worked as an engineer on the Windows Store and Edge teams at Microsoft.

Outside the 8-hours a day in the office, I am also a freelance photographer. You can find my portfolio at [zthall.photos](https://zthall.photos).

### Blog

This is a blog focused mostly on web and mobile design and development. The theme for this blog is based on the [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) open source project from [John Otander](http://johnotander.com).
