### Zack Hall

I'm a designer and developer. I'm an Amazon engineer where I've worked on AWS, Alexa, and Amazon.com. Formerly, I worked as an engineer on the Windows Store and Edge teams at Microsoft.

Together with my wife, we make up the [Burpee Over Bar](http://burpeeoverbar.com) team building beautiful web and mobile experiences for CrossFit. In addition, she is a [personal trainer serving Boston, Melrose, and Everett](https://www.trainingwithvivian.com/).

Outside the 8-hours a day in the office, I am also a [freelance photographer](https://zthall.photos). You can find my portfolio at [zthall.photos](https://zthall.photos).

### Blog

This is a blog focused mostly on web and mobile design and development. The theme for this blog is based on the [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) open source project from [John Otander](http://johnotander.com).
